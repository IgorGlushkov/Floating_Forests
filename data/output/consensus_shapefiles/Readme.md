## Consensus Polygon Data files

These files are quite large and we're working on a permanent hosting solution. In the meantime, please contact us if you would like them.

### Consensus Classifications

**Floating Forests v. 1.0 Consensus Files**
ff_consensus_polys_zone_10.rds - an R binary file of a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame of consensus classifications for UTM zone 10 (Santa Barbara Channel North) projected in WGS84 lat/long
ff_consensus_polys_zone_10.sqlite - The same in SQLite format
ff_consensus_polys_zone_11.rds  an R binary file of a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame of consensus classifications for UTM zone 11 (SB Channel South) projected in WGS84 lat/long
ff_consensus_polys_zone_11.sqlite - The same in SQLite format
ff_consensus_polys_zone_55.rds -  an R binary file of a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame of consensus classifications for UTM zone 55 (Tasmania) projected in WGS8 llat/long
ff_consensus_polys_zone_55.sqlite - The same in SQLite format

**Initial Run Demo**
ff_polys.rds - an R binary file of a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame of consensus classifications in UTM
ff_polys.sqlite - the same polygons in SQLite format
ff_polys_proj.rds - the same polygons projected to WGS84 lat/long
